# ðŸ“Š Data Warehouse & Analytics Project  

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse & Analytics Project**! ðŸš€  
This repository showcases an **end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution**, covering everything from raw data ingestion to delivering actionable business insights.  

Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights **industry-standard practices** in data engineering, data modeling, and analytics.  

---

##  Data Architecture  

The project is built on the **Medallion Architecture** with three structured layers:  

![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)  

1. **Bronze Layer** â€“ Stores raw data ingested directly from source systems (ERP & CRM via CSV files) into SQL Server.  
2. **Silver Layer** â€“ Cleansed, standardized, and transformed data, ensuring quality and consistency.  
3. **Gold Layer** â€“ Business-ready, analytics-optimized data modeled into a **star schema** for reporting.

##  Project Highlights  

This project demonstrates:  

- **Data Architecture** â€“ Designing a modern data warehouse using Medallion principles.  
- **ETL Pipelines** â€“ Extract, transform, and load workflows to move and refine data.  
- **Data Modeling** â€“ Development of **fact** and **dimension** tables for efficient querying.  
- **Analytics & Reporting** â€“ SQL-based analysis and dashboards for business insights.  

Ideal portfolio project for demonstrating skills in:  
- SQL Development  
- Data Engineering  
- ETL & Pipeline Design  
- Data Modeling  
- Business Intelligence & Analytics

##  Project Requirements  

### Objective  
Build a **modern data warehouse on SQL Server** to consolidate ERP and CRM sales data, enabling advanced reporting and data-driven decision-making.  

### Specifications  
- **Data Sources**: Two CSV-based systems (ERP & CRM).  
- **Data Quality**: Cleansing, deduplication, and normalization before analytics.  
- **Integration**: Unified data model, easy to query for business use cases.  
- **Scope**: Focused on the latest snapshot (no historization).  
- **Documentation**: Clear data model documentation for both technical and business users.
